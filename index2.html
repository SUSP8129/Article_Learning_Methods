  <h1>Principles of Learning Methods</h1>
      <div class="Intro"></div>  
      <h2 class="first">1. Are you a "Multi-tasker" or a "Single-tasker?"</h2>
         <p class="one">First, please answer the next question:</p> 
         <p class="one">Considering the definition below, which of the following are you?
         </p>  
          <b class="def">Multi-tasker </b>
              <ul class="list">
                  <li>Recognize widely and shallowly</li>
                  <li>Naturally curious about various things</li>
                  <li>Good at simultaneous processing and simultaneous progress</li>
                  <li>Not good at concentrating deeply on one thing (because they are diffused) </li>
              </ul>
          <p class="blank"></p>
          <b class="def">Single-tasker </b>
              <ul class="list">
                  <li>Concentrate narrowly and deeply</li>
                  <li>Good at think deeply about one thing</li>
                  <li>Not good at simultaneous processing and simultaneous progress</li>
              </ul>    
  
          <p class="one">In other words, when it comes to learning, the multitaskers are better suited for "Horizontal Learning", which allows us to learn about the whole thing shallowly and broadly. Also, single-taskers are better suited for "Vertical Learning", which is the way to learn about one thing exploratory.
          </p>
      <h2 class="second">2. What are "Horizontal Learning" and "Vertical Learning"?</h2>
          <p class="two">Second, we will show the purpose, characteristics, and flow of each learning methods.
          </p>
          <b class="def">Horizontal Learning</b>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Purpose: Understand the whole aspect(s) and relationship
                  </li>
                  <p class="blank"></p>
                  <li>
                    Features: Multi-tasker have this innate ability, but the flood of knowledge causes panic. So, it is necessary to summarize it in a diagram and visualize the structure. Also, as your knowledge expands, you are more likely to discover areas of interest.
                  </li>
                  <p class="blank"></p>
              </ul>    
          <b class="def">Vertical Learning</b>   
              <ul>    
                  <li>
                      Purpose: Narrow down the field and dig deeper
                  </li>
                  <p class="blank"></p>
                  <li>
                      Features: Single-tasker have this innate ability, but it is not suitable for studying in order from the first page. That is why it is important to focus on quality over quantity and start learning in areas that interests you. In addition, this learning method is also the process by which academics is established.
                  </li>
               </ul>    
                  <p class="blank"></p>
                  <b class="def">Flow: As shown in the flowchart below â†“</b>
                  <p class="blank"></p>
                  <img class="flowchart", src="Flowchart1.drawio.png", alt="Flow of two learning methods">
             
      <h2 class="third">3. So what should we do?</h2>
          <p class="three">Basically, as I mentioned earlier, if you are a multi-tasker type, you should practice horizontal learning, and if you are a single-tasker type, you should practice vertical learning. Now, while organizing the things we have introduced so far, we will summarize the approaches for each type.
          </p>
          <b class="def">Multi-tasker type</b>
            <div class="steps">Steps: </div> 
            <div class="approach">
                1. See full table of contents.
            </div>
            <div class="approach">
                2. Keep track of your learning progress at all times.
            </div> 
            <div class="approach">  
                3. When finished, clear the table of contents one by one.
            </div>
            <div class="approach">  
                4. If you come across a field that you find interesting, 
                temporarily study that field in depth 
                (it doesn't matter if the field is narrow).
            </div>
            <div class="approach">
                5. A state of thinking inevitably comes. 
            </div>
          <p class="blank"></p>
          <b class="def">Single-tasker type</b>  
            <div class="steps">Steps: </div>
            <div class="approach">  
                1. Learn more deeply about the field you are currently interested in.
            </div> 
            <div class="approach">
                2. If your interests expand from that field, go with that flow.
            </div>
            <div class="approach">
                3. If you are forced to study a field that you are not interested in,
                 narrow down your focus. 
            </div>    
                 <ul>
                    <li class="point">
                    The trick to narrowing it down is to choose only the most important things, 
                    that is, the things that you absolutely and forever can't solve without knowing about the point.
                    </li>
                </ul>                        
            <div class="approach">
                4. You will naturally be able to solve problems other than the most important ones.
            </div>
        <div class="last">
            If you try the learning method that corresponds to your tasking type and it doesn't work, 
            I think it would be a good idea to try the opposite learning method. 
            Also, it is a good way to change your learning method depending on the situation, 
            regardless of your tasking type.
        </div>
        <div class="last">
            Overall, I hope that the quality of your learning will improve.
